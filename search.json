    "text": "Nebraska has become synonymous with the word “volleyball”. In over 40 years of existence, the Huskers have never come close to producing a losing season and boast five national championships with four of those five coming since 2000. The man leading the Huskers to their first (and second, third and fourth) national title of the 21st century?\nJohn Cook.\nIn 23 years at the helm, Cook helped Nebraska volleyball solidify itself at the forefront of collegiate volleyball and even more recently, helped pack 92,003 red-clad fans into a football stadium on a late August evening to shatter a world record.\nIt took six years for Cook to win another title with the Huskers, which he did in 2006, before not seeing another title until 2015. Since 2015, he collected another title in 2017 and managed two runner-up finishes in 2018 and 2021.\nA two-decade span of dominance, with no foreseeable end in sight, isn’t an easy feat. So one question remains: how is Cook doing it?\nFirst, a look at how Nebraska has fared in national rankings since 2015:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbump)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\n\n\nranks22 &lt;- read_csv(\"ranks22.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2022)\nranks21 &lt;- read_csv(\"ranks21.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2021)\nranks20 &lt;- read_csv(\"ranks20.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2020)\nranks19 &lt;- read_csv(\"ranks19.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2019)\nranks18 &lt;- read_csv(\"ranks18.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2018)\nranks17 &lt;- read_csv(\"ranks17.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2017)\nranks16 &lt;- read_csv(\"ranks16.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2016)\nranks15 &lt;- read_csv(\"ranks15.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2015)\n\nranks &lt;- bind_rows(ranks22, ranks21, ranks20, ranks19, ranks18, ranks17, ranks16, ranks15)\n\nchamps &lt;- c(\"Nebraska\", \"Wisconsin\", \"Stanford\", \"Kentucky\", \"Texas\")\n\nrankings &lt;- ranks |&gt; pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"Week\"), names_to = \"Week\", values_to = \"Rank\") |&gt; \n group_by(Team, Season) |&gt; \n    select(Team, Season, Week, Rank)  |&gt; \n  filter(Team %in% champs) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    AvgRank = mean(Rank)\n  )\n\nggplot() + geom_bump(data=rankings, aes(x=Season, y=AvgRank, color=Team)) +\n   geom_point(data=rankings, aes(x=Season, y=AvgRank, color=Team), size = 4) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"blue\",  \"#E41C38\", \"red\", \"orange\", \"#C5050C\")) +\n  geom_text(data = rankings |&gt; filter(Season == min(Season)), aes(x = Season - .2, y=AvgRank, label = Team), size = 3, hjust = 1) +\n  geom_text(data = rankings |&gt; filter(Season == max(Season)), aes(x = Season + .2, y=AvgRank, label = Team), size = 3, hjust = 0) +\n  labs(\n    title=\"Nebraska is an undoubted Blue Blood\", \n    subtitle=\"In AVCA polls, the Huskers have remained one of the most consistent of the recent national champions \\n averaging a top-10 ranking in every season since the 2015.\",\n    caption= \"Source: American Volleyball Coaches Association | By Jay Mingo\",\n    y= \"Average Rank\", \n    x = \"Season\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank()\n    ) +\n  scale_y_reverse(breaks=c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(2014,2023)) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Huskers averaged a top-10 ranking since 2015 and have failed to fall outside of that coveted position. Among the other national champions since 2015, Nebraska has maintained consistency in its rankings and as of the 2022 season, sat behind Texas in average ranking. And in case you missed it: the Longhorns hoisted a trophy at the end of that season.\nThe Huskers have been a good team, a perennial powerhouse, an emblem of volleyball royalty since 2015, sure. But averaging a top-10 ranking isn’t easy, so how exactly has Cook done it?\nThe first part: defense. And let the record state: he digs defense.\n\n\nCode\ndigs23 &lt;- read_csv(\"digs23.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2023)\ndigs22 &lt;- read_csv(\"digs22.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2022)\ndigs21 &lt;- read_csv(\"digs21.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2021)\ndigs20 &lt;- read_csv(\"digs20.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2020)\ndigs19 &lt;- read_csv(\"digs19.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2019)\ndigs18 &lt;- read_csv(\"digs18.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2018)\ndigs17 &lt;- read_csv(\"digs17.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2017)\ndigs16 &lt;- read_csv(\"digs16.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2016)\ndigs15 &lt;- read_csv(\"digs15 (2).csv\") |&gt;  mutate(Season = 2015)\n\ndigs &lt;- bind_rows(digs23, digs22, digs21, digs20, digs19, digs18, digs17, digs16, digs15)\n\ndigging &lt;- digs |&gt; \n  separate(Player, into=c(\"Player\", \"School\"), sep=\",\") |&gt; \n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(FL)\", \"FL\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(NY)\", \"NY\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(PA)\", \"PA\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; \n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(CA)\", \"CA\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; \n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(OH)\", \"OH\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; \n  separate(School, into=c(\"School\", \"Conference\"), sep=\"\\\\(\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Conference=gsub(\")\", \"\", Conference)) |&gt; \n  separate(Ht, into=c(\"Feet\", \"Inches\"), sep=\"-\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Feet = as.numeric(Feet), Inches = as.numeric(Inches)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Height = (Feet*12)+Inches) |&gt; \n  mutate(School = str_trim(School))\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\nstars &lt;- digging |&gt; \n  filter(S &gt; 90 & `Per Set` &gt; 3.5)\n\nneb &lt;- stars |&gt; \n  filter(School == \"Nebraska\")\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_beeswarm(data=stars, aes(x=Season, y=Digs), color=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=neb, aes(x=Season, y=Digs), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=neb, aes(x=Season, y=Digs, label=Player)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 524.3218, color=\"darkblue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2019, y=545, label=\"Average Digs since 2015\"), color=\"blue\", size=3.25) + \ntheme_minimal() + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Season\",\n    y=\"Total Digs\", \n    title=\"Nebraska is LiberoU\", \n    subtitle=\"In four of the Huskers' last eight seasons, the play of an Olympic and a future Olympic libero has made \\n all the difference in postseason longevity.\", \n    caption=\"Source: stats.ncaa.com | By Jay Mingo\"\n    ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Huskers have produced a pair of highly efficient liberos and when those liberos were digging above the average of total digs in the past eight years, their teams were playing in national championships. When those liberos tallied fewer digs than the average, Nebraska didn’t make it beyond the Final Four. The presence, or respective lack thereof, of these liberos is directly reflected in some of the Huskers’ more successful seasons.\nComplementary performances for Nebraska make up the second part: its front row swings for kills. Here’s the top-10 hitting percentages of Huskers since 2015 and heads up: they’re all middle blockers.\n\n\nCode\nhit23 &lt;- read_csv(\"hitting23.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2023)\nhit22 &lt;- read_csv(\"hitting22.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2022)\nhit21 &lt;- read_csv(\"hitting21.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2021)\nhit20 &lt;- read_csv(\"hitting20.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2020)\nhit19 &lt;- read_csv(\"hitting19.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2019)\nhit18 &lt;- read_csv(\"hitting18.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2018)\nhit17 &lt;- read_csv(\"hitting17.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2017)\nhit16 &lt;- read_csv(\"hitting16.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2016)\nhit15 &lt;- read_csv(\"hitting15.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2015) \n\nhitting &lt;- bind_rows(hit23, hit22, hit21, hit20, hit19, hit18, hit17, hit16, hit15)\n\nattackers &lt;- hitting |&gt; \n  separate(Player, into=c(\"Player\", \"School\"), sep=\",\") |&gt; \n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(FL)\", \"FL\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(NY)\", \"NY\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(PA)\", \"PA\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; \n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(CA)\", \"CA\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; \n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(OH)\", \"OH\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; \n  separate(School, into=c(\"School\", \"Conference\"), sep=\"\\\\(\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Conference=gsub(\")\", \"\", Conference)) |&gt; \n  mutate(School = str_trim(School))\n\ngbr &lt;- attackers |&gt; \n  filter(School == \"Nebraska\") |&gt; \n  select(Player, Pct., Season, Pos) |&gt; \n  top_n(10, wt=Pct.) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(Pct.))\n\ngbr |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    Pct. = \"Hitting Percentage\",\n    Pos = \"Position\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"(Front) Row the Boat\", \n    subtitle = \"The Huskers' middles have ushered their teams to postseason success. \\n In 2015 and 2017, Nebraska won a national title.

They’re humans. Human error makes the game of baseball, baseball. Whether it’s a third baseman misreading a ball’s bounce, a manager keeping his ace in one half-inning too long, or a fan reaching over the wall and costing their team an out. Regardless of how it manifests, errors are common in baseball and umpires face the most scrutiny for theirs.\nIn 2023, a significant portion of umpires posted highs of over 96% accuracy in a game during the season, with some doing it multiple times. A 4% difference from perfection still means that there were mistakes and wrong calls, but fans can find ways to forgive umpires who make sparse mistakes. However, several umpires finished below 88% in accuracy, meaning over 10% of their calls in a game were wrong.\nWhile many umpires kept their difference between their most accurate and inaccurate performances to a justifiable amount, MLB fan-favorite Angel Hernandez’s roughly 12% swing was one of the worst throughout the season and led to a continuation of years of fan backlash against him in his profession.\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(1234)\n\nincorrectcalls &lt;- umps |&gt; \n  filter(\n    G &gt; 0)\n\ngamechangers &lt;- incorrectcalls |&gt; \n  filter(\n      IC &gt; 273\n  ) |&gt; \n  select(Umpire, IC, avgTRI) |&gt; \n  arrange(-avgTRI)\n\nfiveworst &lt;- gamechangers |&gt; \n  top_n(5)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=incorrectcalls, \n    aes(x=avgTRI, y=IC), color=\"grey\"\n  ) +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=fiveworst, \n    aes(x=avgTRI, y=IC), color=\"blue\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\ndata=fiveworst, \n    aes(x=avgTRI, y=IC, label=Umpire)) +\n    geom_hline(yintercept = 227.0851, color=\"darkblue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=1.75, y=220, label=\"Average Total of Incorrect Calls in 2023\"), color=\"blue\", size=3.25) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Average Total Run Impact\",\n    y=\"Incorrect Calls\", \n    title=\"Case for Robo Umps?\", \n    subtitle=\"Seven of MLB's most incorrect umpires affected the final outcomes of contests in 2023 by one or more runs.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Umpire Scorecards | By: Jay Mingo\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\") \n\n\n\n\n\nUmpires underperform, some days are better than others - what profession can’t relate to this concept? What person can’t relate to it? That’s a rhetorical question.\nBut when missed calls turn into game-changing runs for the other team or missed out by one’s team, those mistakes and bad days at the office begin to matter.\nOf the initial 10 underperforming umpires, three impacted outcomes by 1.5 or more runs, but one has made an appearance in three categories. Wendelstedt underperformed the most, failed to reach over 96% accuracy and produced some of the most incorrect calls while affecting scores.\nWith several of dozens of umpires working in MLB in 2023, there is ample opportunity for several to claim the title as the worst umpire, but only one man can be the title-bearer.\nThat one man is Hunter Wendelstedt, MLB’s worst umpire in 2023."
