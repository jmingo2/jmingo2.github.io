    "text": "Nebraska has become synonymous with the word “volleyball”. In over 40 years of existence, the Huskers have never come close to producing a losing season and boast five national championships with four of those five coming since 2000. The man leading the Huskers to their first (and second, third and fourth) national title of the 21st century?\nJohn Cook.\nIn 23 years at the helm, Cook helped Nebraska volleyball solidify itself at the forefront of collegiate volleyball and even more recently, helped pack 92,003 red-clad fans into a football stadium on a late August evening to shatter a world record.\nIt took six years for Cook to win another title with the Huskers, which he did in 2006, before not seeing another title until 2015. Since 2015, he collected another title in 2017 and managed two runner-up finishes in 2018 and 2021.\nA two-decade span of dominance, with no foreseeable end in sight, isn’t an easy feat. So one question remains: how is Cook doing it?\nFirst, a look at how Nebraska has fared in national rankings since 2015:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbump)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\n\n\nranks22 &lt;- read_csv(\"ranks22.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2022)\nranks21 &lt;- read_csv(\"ranks21.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2021)\nranks20 &lt;- read_csv(\"ranks20.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2020)\nranks19 &lt;- read_csv(\"ranks19.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2019)\nranks18 &lt;- read_csv(\"ranks18.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2018)\nranks17 &lt;- read_csv(\"ranks17.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2017)\nranks16 &lt;- read_csv(\"ranks16.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2016)\nranks15 &lt;- read_csv(\"ranks15.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2015)\n\nranks &lt;- bind_rows(ranks22, ranks21, ranks20, ranks19, ranks18, ranks17, ranks16, ranks15)\n\nchamps &lt;- c(\"Nebraska\", \"Wisconsin\", \"Stanford\", \"Kentucky\", \"Texas\")\n\nrankings &lt;- ranks |&gt; pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"Week\"), names_to = \"Week\", values_to = \"Rank\") |&gt; \n group_by(Team, Season) |&gt; \n    select(Team, Season, Week, Rank)  |&gt; \n  filter(Team %in% champs) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    AvgRank = mean(Rank)\n  )\n\nggplot() + geom_bump(data=rankings, aes(x=Season, y=AvgRank, color=Team)) +\n   geom_point(data=rankings, aes(x=Season, y=AvgRank, color=Team), size = 4) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"blue\",  \"#E41C38\", \"red\", \"orange\", \"#C5050C\")) +\n  geom_text(data = rankings |&gt; filter(Season == min(Season)), aes(x = Season - .2, y=AvgRank, label = Team), size = 3, hjust = 1) +\n  geom_text(data = rankings |&gt; filter(Season == max(Season)), aes(x = Season + .2, y=AvgRank, label = Team), size = 3, hjust = 0) +\n  labs(\n    title=\"Nebraska is an undoubted Blue Blood\", \n    subtitle=\"In AVCA polls, the Huskers have remained one of the most consistent of the recent national champions \\n averaging a top-10 ranking in every season since the 2015.\",\n    caption= \"Source: American Volleyball Coaches Association | By Jay Mingo\",\n    y= \"Average Rank\", \n    x = \"Season\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank()\n    ) +\n  scale_y_reverse(breaks=c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(2014,2023)) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Huskers averaged a top-10 ranking since 2015 and have failed to fall outside of that coveted position. Among the other national champions since 2015, Nebraska has maintained consistency in its rankings and as of the 2022 season, sat behind Texas in average ranking. And in case you missed it: the Longhorns hoisted a trophy at the end of that season.\nThe Huskers have been a good team, a perennial powerhouse, an emblem of volleyball royalty since 2015, sure. But averaging a top-10 ranking isn’t easy, so how exactly has Cook done it?\nThe first part: defense. And let the record state: he digs defense.\n\n\nCode\ndigs23 &lt;- read_csv(\"digs23.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2023)\ndigs22 &lt;- read_csv(\"digs22.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2022)\ndigs21 &lt;- read_csv(\"digs21.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2021)\ndigs20 &lt;- read_csv(\"digs20.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2020)\ndigs19 &lt;- read_csv(\"digs19.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2019)\ndigs18 &lt;- read_csv(\"digs18.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2018)\ndigs17 &lt;- read_csv(\"digs17.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2017)\ndigs16 &lt;- read_csv(\"digs16.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2016)\ndigs15 &lt;- read_csv(\"digs15 (2).csv\") |&gt;  mutate(Season = 2015)\n\ndigs &lt;- bind_rows(digs23, digs22, digs21, digs20, digs19, digs18, digs17, digs16, digs15)\n\ndigging &lt;- digs |&gt; \n  separate(Player, into=c(\"Player\", \"School\"), sep=\",\") |&gt; \n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(FL)\", \"FL\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(NY)\", \"NY\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(PA)\", \"PA\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; \n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(CA)\", \"CA\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; \n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(OH)\", \"OH\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; \n  separate(School, into=c(\"School\", \"Conference\"), sep=\"\\\\(\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Conference=gsub(\")\", \"\", Conference)) |&gt; \n  separate(Ht, into=c(\"Feet\", \"Inches\"), sep=\"-\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Feet = as.numeric(Feet), Inches = as.numeric(Inches)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Height = (Feet*12)+Inches) |&gt; \n  mutate(School = str_trim(School))\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\nstars &lt;- digging |&gt; \n  filter(S &gt; 90 & `Per Set` &gt; 3.5)\n\nneb &lt;- stars |&gt; \n  filter(School == \"Nebraska\")\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_beeswarm(data=stars, aes(x=Season, y=Digs), color=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=neb, aes(x=Season, y=Digs), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=neb, aes(x=Season, y=Digs, label=Player)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 524.3218, color=\"darkblue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2019, y=545, label=\"Average Digs since 2015\"), color=\"blue\", size=3.25) + \ntheme_minimal() + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Season\",\n    y=\"Total Digs\", \n    title=\"Nebraska is LiberoU\", \n    subtitle=\"In four of the Huskers' last eight seasons, the play of an Olympic and a future Olympic libero has made \\n all the difference in postseason longevity.\", \n    caption=\"Source: stats.ncaa.com | By Jay Mingo\"\n    ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Huskers have produced a pair of highly efficient liberos and when those liberos were digging above the average of total digs in the past eight years, their teams were playing in national championships. When those liberos tallied fewer digs than the average, Nebraska didn’t make it beyond the Final Four. The presence, or respective lack thereof, of these liberos is directly reflected in some of the Huskers’ more successful seasons.\nComplementary performances for Nebraska make up the second part: its front row swings for kills. Here’s the top-10 hitting percentages of Huskers since 2015 and heads up: they’re all middle blockers.\n\n\nCode\nhit23 &lt;- read_csv(\"hitting23.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2023)\nhit22 &lt;- read_csv(\"hitting22.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2022)\nhit21 &lt;- read_csv(\"hitting21.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2021)\nhit20 &lt;- read_csv(\"hitting20.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2020)\nhit19 &lt;- read_csv(\"hitting19.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2019)\nhit18 &lt;- read_csv(\"hitting18.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2018)\nhit17 &lt;- read_csv(\"hitting17.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2017)\nhit16 &lt;- read_csv(\"hitting16.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2016)\nhit15 &lt;- read_csv(\"hitting15.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2015) \n\nhitting &lt;- bind_rows(hit23, hit22, hit21, hit20, hit19, hit18, hit17, hit16, hit15)\n\nattackers &lt;- hitting |&gt; \n  separate(Player, into=c(\"Player\", \"School\"), sep=\",\") |&gt; \n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(FL)\", \"FL\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(NY)\", \"NY\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(PA)\", \"PA\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; \n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(CA)\", \"CA\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; \n  mutate(School = gsub(\"(OH)\", \"OH\", School, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; \n  separate(School, into=c(\"School\", \"Conference\"), sep=\"\\\\(\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Conference=gsub(\")\", \"\", Conference)) |&gt; \n  mutate(School = str_trim(School))\n\ngbr &lt;- attackers |&gt; \n  filter(School == \"Nebraska\") |&gt; \n  select(Player, Pct., Season, Pos) |&gt; \n  top_n(10, wt=Pct.) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(Pct.))\n\ngbr |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    Pct. = \"Hitting Percentage\",\n    Pos = \"Position\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"(Front) Row the Boat\", \n    subtitle = \"The Huskers' middles have ushered their teams to postseason success. \\n In 2015 and 2017, Nebraska won a national title.

Not to mention, there is not a single senior on the 2023 team.\nThe ingredients for 2023 are there and the Huskers continue to seek their first perfect season since 2000. Same Cook, different ingredients and the same goals, but only time will tell Cook’s recipe for success."
